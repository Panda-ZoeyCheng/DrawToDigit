# DrawToDigit

**DrawToDigit** is a web application that allows users to draw digits (0-9) on a canvas and have them recognized by a machine learning model. This project is designed as a fun and educational tool to demonstrate how a model can recognize handwritten digits.

## Functions

- Users can draw a digit using the canvas on the webpage.
- When the "Predict" button is clicked, the drawing is sent to a backend server.
- The backend uses a pre-trained model to identify the digit.
- The recognized digit is displayed on the page.
- Users can also clear the canvas and draw again, or save their drawing.

## Why Project?

This project demonstrates how to build a full-stack app using React, Flask, and a custom-trained machine learning model using Jupyter Notebook for digit recognition.
